        "Superposition is a crucially important concept for understanding how transformers work. A definition from Neel Nanda's glossary:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Superposition is when a model represents more than n features in an $n$-dimensional activation space. That is, features still correspond to directions, but **the set of interpretable directions is larger than the number of dimensions**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why should we expect something like this to happen? In general, the world has way more features than the model has dimensions of freedom, and so we can't have a one-to-one mapping between features and values in our model. But the model has to represent these features somehow. Hence, it comes up with techniques for cramming multiple features into fewer dimensions (at the cost of adding noise and interference between features).\n",
        "\n",
        "In these exercises, feel free to skip sections liberally. Specifically, we recommend skipping sections 3️⃣ and 4️⃣ unless you're particularly interested in exploring those topics in depth. If your goal is to get quickly to the cutting edge of SAE research without spending too much time wading through the theory, you can jump directly to section 0️⃣ in 1.3.2 (which offers a compressed version of sections 1️⃣, 2️⃣ and 5️⃣ in this material, before moving on to studying SAEs in actual LLMs).\n",

        "Unlike many other topics in this chapter, there's quite a bit of theory which needs to be understood before we start making inferences from the results of our coding experiments. A key point to make here is that, perhaps more so than any other section in this chapter, we really don't understand superposition that well at all! It's hard to point to the seminal work in this field because we don't really know what the critical new insights will look like. That being said, we hope this material gives you enough directions to pursue when you're finished!"

        ">\n",
        "> - Understand the concept of superposition, and how it helps models represent a larger set of features\n",
        "> - Understand the difference between superposition and polysemanticity\n",
        "> - Learn how sparsity contributes to superposition\n",

        "\n",
        "Superposition in a privileged basis is a bit different than a nonprivileged basis. Firstly, the model has a tendency to align more with the basis directions (even though it often needs some degree of misalignment in order to represent all features). Secondly, many privileged bases are privileged because they are performing some kind of computation on their inputs, rather than just storing representations, so it's important to understand how our model is able to perform this computation.\n",

It's not as essential as any exercises from the previous three sections, but should still be of interest and worth doing if you have time, or just want to dive more deeply into superposition. We cover **dimensionality** (a measure of how much capacity the model is affording to a single feature), and relate this metric to the forming of increasingly complex geometric structures.\n",

        "Deep Double Descent is a long observed phenomena in deep learning, wherein the model's performance on a task first improves with model size, then plateaus, then starts to decrease again with further increases in model size. The plateau is in line with the predictions of classical statistics (i.e. model overfitting), but the further decrease isn't. Anthropic's paper on deep double descent connects this phenomenon to the idea of superposition, essentially arguing that the two scaling phases represent a memorizing solution and a generalizing solution respectively, with the first characterized by representing *datapoints* in superposition, the second by representing *features* in superposition.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Importance** = the coefficient on the weighted mean squared error between the input and output, which we use for training the model\n",
        "    * In other words, our loss function is $L = \\sum_x \\sum_i I_i (x_i - x_i^\\prime)^2$, where $I_i$ is the importance of feature $i$.\n",
        "* **Sparsity** = the probability of the corresponding element in $x$ being zero\n",
        "    * In other words, this affects the way our training data is generated (see the method `generate_batch` in the `Module` class below)\n",
        "    * We often refer to **feature probability** (1 minus sparsity) rather than sparsity\n",
        "\n",
        "The justification for using $W^T W$ is as follows: we can think of $W$ (which is a matrix of shape `(2, 5)`) as a grid of \"overlap values\" between the features and bottleneck dimensions. The values of the 5x5 matrix $W^T W$ are the dot products between the 2D representations of each pair of features. To make this intuition clearer, imagine each of the columns of $W$ were unit vectors, then $W^T W$ would be a matrix of cosine similarities between the features (with diagonal elements equal to 1, because the similarity of a feature with itself is 1).

Also, the sparsity of all features is increasing as we move from left to right (at the far left there is no sparsity, at the far right feature probability is 5% for all features, i.e. sparsity of 95%).\n",

        "When there is no sparsity, the model can never represent more than 2 features faithfully, so it makes sense for it to only represent the two most important features. It stores them orthogonally in 2D space, and sets the other 3 features to zero. This way, it can reconstruct these two features perfectly, and ignores all the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "When there is high sparsity, we get a pentagon structure. Most of the time at most one of these five features will be active, which helps avoid **interference** between features. When we try to recover our initial features by projecting our point in 2D space onto these five directions, most of the time when feature $i$ is present, we can be confident that our projection onto the $i$-th feature direction only captures this feature, rather than being affected by the presence of other features. We omit the mathematical details here.\n",

        "The key idea here is that two forces are competing in our model: **feature benefit** (representing more thing is good!), and **interference** (representing things non-orthogonally is bad). The higher the sparsity, the more we can reduce the negative impact of interference, and so the trade-off skews towards \"represent more features, non-orthogonally\".\n",

        "</details>\n",

        "\n",
        "We can also generate a batch and visualise its embedding. Most interestingly, you should see that in the plots with high sparsity (to the right), we very rarely have interference between the five features, because most often $\\leq 1$ of those features is present, and the model can recover it by projecting along the corresponding feature dimension without losing any information."

        "The reason antipodal pairs are better for handling anticorrelated features is that the model can be sure only one of these antipodal pairs will be active at a time, so they won't interfere with each other. So effectively we can be sure that a maximum of 2 directions will be non-zero at a time, and those 2 directions are guaranteed to be orthogonal if they co-occur (because they're from 2 different orthogonal pairs, which lie in orthogonal subspaces to each other). So we can get zero loss. If we don't have antipodal pairs, then we'll sometimes get interference between features from different feature pairs (since their directions might be antipodal).\n",

        "The key point here - antipodal pairs are only better because they handle interference better, i.e. the cases where both feature pairs are active. This happens with $O(p^2)$ probability (where $p$ is the feature probability). So for very small values of $p$, the edge that the antipodal solution has over the non-antipodal solution is much smaller, and it may end up just settling on whichever solution it finds first.\n",

Instead, we sometimes have **asymmetric superposition**, where a single neuron detects two different features $i$ and $j$, and stores these features with different magnitudes (assume the $W_1$ vector for feature $i$ is much larger). The $W_2$ vectors have flipped magnitudes (i.e. the vector for $j$ is much larger). When $i$ is present and $j$ is not, there's no problem, because the output for feature $i$ is `large * small` (correct size) and for $j$ is `small * small` (near zero). But when $j$ is present and $i$ is not, the output for feature $j$ is `small * large` (correct size) and for $i$ is `large * large` (much larger than it should be). In particular, this is bad when the sign of output for $i$ is positive. The model fixes this by repurposing another neuron to correct for the case when $j$ is present and $i$ is not. We omit the exact mechanism, but it takes advantage of the fact that the model has a ReLU at the very end, so it doesn't matter if output for a feature is very large and negative (the loss will be truncated at zero), but being large and positive is very bad.\n",

We've given you code below to replicate the results of this plot - note that some plots will display the kind of asymmetric superposition described above, whereas others will simply have a single pair of neurons for each feature - you might have to fun a few random seeds to observe something exactly resembling Anthropic's plots. Can you understand what the output represents? Can you play around with the hyperparameters to see how this behaviour varies (e.g. with different feature probability or importance)?"

But this is a simplification: there are actually many phases of ice, often corresponding to different crystal structures (eg. hexagonal vs cubic ice).

        "What does it mean to represent datapoints in superposition? If you've done the exercises on correlated / anticorrelated features in an earlier section, you'll know that anticorrelated features are easier to represent in superposition because they don't interfere with each other. This is especially true if features aren't just anticorrelated but are **mutually exclusive**. From the Anthropic paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Consider the case of a language model which verbatim memorizes text. How can it do this? One naive idea is that it might use neurons to create a lookup table mapping sequences to arbitrary continuations. For every sequence of tokens it wishes to memorize, it could dedicate one neuron to detecting that sequence, and then implement arbitrary behavior when it fires. The problem with this approach is that it's extremely inefficient – but it seems like a perfect candidate for superposition, since each case is mutually exclusive and can't interfere.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll study this theory in the context of a toy model. Specifically, we'll use the toy model that we worked with in the first section of this paper, but we'll train it in a very particular way: by generating a random batch of data, and then using that same batch for the entire training process. We'll see what happens when the batch sizes change, but the number of features change. According to our theory, the model should represent datapoints in superposition when the batch size is smaller than the number of features, and it should represent features in superposition when the batch size is larger than the number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than giving you a set of exercises to complete, we're leaving this section open-ended. You should consider it more as a paper replication than a set of structured exercises. However, we will give you a few tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Rather than using the Adam optimizer, the paper recommends AdamW, with a default weight decay of `WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-2`.\n",
        "    * Weight decay constrains the norm of weights, so that they don't grow too large. With no weight decay, we could in theory memorize an arbitrarily large number of datapoints and represent them evenly spaced around the unit circle; then we can perfectly reconstruct them as long as we have a large enough weight vector to project them onto.\n",
        "* The paper recommends a learning rate consisting of a linear warmup up to `NUM_WARMUP_STEPS = 2500` (i.e. we increase the learning rate linearly from zero up to `LEARNING_RATE = 1e-3`), followed by cosine decay until the end of training at `NUM_BATCH_UPDATES = 50_000`.\n",
        "* The paper recommends using a sparsity of 0.999 for the features, and 10,000 features total. However, we recommend instead using `SPARSITY = 0.99` and `N_FEATURES = 1000` (following the replication by Marius Hobbhahn). This will cause our model to train faster, while still observing fundamentally the same patterns.\n",
        "* When generating the batch of data, you should normalize it (so each vector for a given batch index & instance has unit norm). The rest of the data generation process should be the same as in the first section of this notebook.\n",
        "* Technically you only need one instance. However, we recommend using a few (e.g. 5-10) so you can pick the instance with lowest loss at the end of training. This is because (thanks to our best frend randomness) not all instances will necessarily learn the optimal solution. In our implementation (code below), we rewrite the `optimize` function to return `(batch_inst, W_inst)` at the end, where `batch_inst` is the batch which had the lowest loss by the end of training, and `W_inst` are the learned weights for that same instance. This is precisely the data you'll need to make the 2D feature plots featured in the paper.\n",
        "* You can repurpose the function to calculate **dimensionality** from the section on feature geometry. See the paper for a discussion of a generalized dimensionality function, which doesn't just measure dimensionality of features, but also of datapoints.\n",

Sometimes they're called **neurons** (since they do have an activation function applied to them which makes them a privileged basis, like the neurons in an MLP layer). Sometimes they're called **features**, since the idea with SAEs is that these hidden activations are meant to refer to specific features in the data. However, the word feature is a bit [overloaded](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9Nkb389gidsozY9Tf/lewis-smith-s-shortform#fd64ALuWK8rXdLKz6) - ideally we want to use \"feature\" to refer to the attributes of the data itself - if our SAE's weights are randomly initialized, is it fair to call this a feature?!\n",

        "For this reason, we'll be referring to the autoencoder's hidden activations as **SAE latents**. However, it's worth noting that people sometimes use \"SAE features\" or \"neurons\" instead, so try not to get confused (e.g. often people use \"neuron resampling\" to refer to the resampling of the weights in the SAE).\n",

        "- `d_in`, which is the SAE input dimension. This is the same as `d_hidden` from the previous sections because the SAE is reconstructing the model's hidden activations, however calling it `d_hidden` in the context of an SAE would be confusing.

        "The main difference we'll make is in how the resampled values are chosen. Rather than just drawing them randomly from a distribution and normalizing them, we'll be **sampling them with replacement from a set of input activations $h$, with sampling probabilities weighted by the squared $L_2$ loss of the autoencoder on each input**. Intuitively, this will make it more likely that our resampled neurons will represent feature directions that the autoencoder is currently doing a bad job of representing.\n",

        "* Generate a batch of hidden data `h` from your SAE and compute its squared reconstruction loss `l2_squared`. It should have shape `(batch_size, n_inst)`. If the L2 loss for this instance `l2_squared[:, inst]` is zero everywhere, we can skip this instance.\n",
        "* Find the dead latents for this instance (i.e. the values `(inst, d)` where `frac_active_in_window[:, inst, d]` are all zero).\n",
        "* For each of these, do the following:\n",
        "    * Randomly sample a vector `v = h[x, inst, :]`, where `0 <= x < batch_size` is chosen according to the distribution with probabilities proportional to `l2_squared[:, inst]`.\n",
        "    * Set the decoder weights `W_dec[inst, d, :]` to this new vector `v`, normalized.\n",
        "    * Set the encoder weights `W_enc[inst, :, d]` to this new vector `v`, scaled to have norm `resample_scale * avg_W_enc_alive_norm` (where the term `avg_W_enc_alive_norm` is the mean norm of the encoder weights of alive neurons for that particular instance).\n",

        "1. **Empirically, features usually seem to want to be binary.** For instance, we often see features like \"is this about a basketball\" which are better thought of as \"off\" or \"on\" than occupying some continuous range from 0 to 1. In practice reconstructing the precise coefficients does matter, and they often seem important for indicating something like the model's confidence in a particular feature being present. But still, we'd ideally like an architecture which can learn this discontinuity.\n",

The two loss term in the SAE loss function have conflicting goals: the reconstruction term wants to make the autoencoder good at reconstructing the input, and the sparsity term wants to shrink the magnitude of the hidden layer. This means that even when perfect reconstruction is possible with only a single hidden unit activated, the sparsity loss will bias the magnitude of this hidden unit to zero, and the reconstruction will be worse.  \n",

So eventually they'll hit zero, and won't receive any more gradients (because the model's output will just always be zero from that point onwards). To combat this, we add an auxiliary loss term equal to the reconstruction loss when we swap out the true latent activations for the preactivation values $\\pi_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})$.

The left histogram shows the distribution along a particular feature direction - the blue represents the distribution from interference when the feature is off but other non-orthogonal features are on, and the red represents the distribution then the feature is on. The distributions form a clearly bimodal pattern, and we can see in the figure on the right how a jump discontinuity (like the one provided by ReLU or by Gated models) can better model this discontinuity, by correctly reconstructing more of the interference cases (blue) as zero.\n",

In fact, you can try replicating this exact plot yourself and showing exactly how your Gated model outperforms the standard model.\n",

If you want to attempt it, we recommend you get help from Claude or ChatGPT to create the visualization - the important part is understanding the plot well enough to know what data you need to gather in order to replicate it. Also, note that our toy model setup is slightly different from the paper's - we're using 5 independent features and so the \"X off\" distribution is down to interference from the other features, whereas the paper only considers a single feature and predefines an \"X on\" and \"X off\" distribution.

        "- We've given you the `rectangle` helper function which you can use in both implementations.\n",
        "- You don't have to worry about broadcasting issues in this exercise, since PyTorch's autograd mechanism will handle this for you (for example if the gradient for `theta` you return from `backward` has a leading batch dimension meaning it's not the same shape as `theta`, it will automatically be summed over that dimension before being added to `theta.grad`). However, if you want to exactly match DeepMind's pseudocode in their paper appendix then you're certainly welcome to make this summing explicit. For more on the subtleties of summing & broadcasting over dimensions during backprop, see the first ARENA chapter!"
