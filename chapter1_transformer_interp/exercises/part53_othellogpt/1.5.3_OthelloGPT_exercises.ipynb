        "\n",
        "[Emergent World Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13382) is a fascinating recent ICLR Oral paper from Kenneth Li et al, summarised in [Kenneth's excellent post on the Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/othello/). They trained a model (Othello-GPT) to play legal moves in the board game Othello, by giving it random games (generated by choosing a legal next move uniformly at random) and training it to predict the next move. The headline result is that Othello-GPT learns an emergent world representation - despite never being explicitly given the state of the board, and just being tasked to predict the next move, it learns to compute the state of the board at each move. (Note that the point of Othello-GPT is to play legal moves, not good moves, though they also study a model trained to play good moves.)\n",
        "\n",
        "They present two main pieces of evidence. They can extract the board state from the model's residual stream via non-linear probes (a two layer ReLU MLP). And they can use the probes to causally intervene and change the model's representation of the board (by using gradient descent to have the probes output the new board state) - the model now makes legal moves in the new board state even if they are not legal in the old board, and even if that board state is impossible to reach by legal play!\n",
        "\n",
        "I've strengthened their headline result by finding that much of their more sophisticated (and thus potentially misleading) techniques can be significantly simplified. Not only does the model learn an emergent world representation, it learns a linear emergent world representation, which can be causally intervened on in a linear way! But rather than representing \"this square has a black/white piece\", it represents \"this square has my/their piece\". The model plays both black and white moves, so this is far more natural from its perspective. With this insight, the whole picture clarifies significantly, and the model becomes far more interpretable!\n",

        "### The research process\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about the research process in [this post here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/nhGNHyJHbrofpPbRG/p/TAz44Lb9n9yf52pv8), which we'd strongly recommend. The exercises are structured in a different way to the chronological research process (e.g. we look at probes early on, when actually training a probe is a high-effort thing and if you were trying to get traction on a problem like this you'd want to use more basic techniques first, like logit lens / attention pattern analysis).\n",
        "\n",
        "As you're going through these exercises, we encourage you to keep thinking about how you would approach this research process. Do any of the results / approaches seem completely out of the blue for you, and if so can you think about what the justification might have been for trying them? What would you have tried first, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "### How you should approach these exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a lot of setup code for analysing OthelloGPT (this is somewhat unavoidable). There are also a lot of different plots of tensors with different dimensions and different meanings, and it can be hard to keep track of. You don't have to keep track of all of this in your head, but **we strongly recommend explaining to yourself or your pair programming partner what the significance of each result is before you move on to the next section.** Sometimes exercises and questions will prompt you to do this, but you should make it a reflex!\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of each subsection in the first section (which mostly consists of setup), there's a recap of all the objects we've defined, why they matter, and how they can be used. There will also be a \"recap of this section\" at the end of each of the later sections, where we review the key results and their significance."

        "But despite the model just needing to predict the next move, it spontaneously learned to compute the full board state at each move - a fascinating result. A pretty hot question right now is whether LLMs are just bundles of statistical correlations or have some real understanding and computation! This gives suggestive evidence that simple objectives to predict the next token can create rich emergent structure (at least in the toy setting of Othello). Rather than just learning surface level statistics about the distribution of moves, it learned to model the underlying process that generated that data. In my opinion, it's already pretty obvious that transformers can do something more than statistical correlations and pattern matching, see eg [induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), but it's great to have clearer evidence of fully-fledged world models!\n",

It's crucial to track whether the probe is just reading out the feature, or actually computing the feature itself, and reading out much simpler features from the model. In the extreme case, you could attach a much more powerful model as your \"probe\", and have it just extract the input moves, and then compute the board state from scratch! They found that linear probes did not work to recover board state (with an error rate of 20.4%): (ie, projecting the residual stream onto some 3 learned directions for each square, corresponding to empty, black and white logits). While the simplest non-linear probes (a two layer MLP with a single hidden ReLU layer) worked extremely well (an error rate of 1.7%). Further (as described in their table 2, screenshot below), these non-linear probes did not work on a randomly initialised network, and worked better on some layers than others, suggesting they were learning something real from the model.\n",

But their causal interventions make this much more compelling evidence. They intervene by a fairly convoluted process (detailed in the figure below, though you don't need to understand the details), which boils down to choosing a new board state, and applying gradient descent to the model's residual stream such that our probe thinks the model's residual stream represents the new board state. I have an immediate skepticism of any complex technique like this: when applying a powerful method like gradient descent it's so easy to wildly diverge from what the models original functioning is like! But the fact that the model could do the non-trivial computation of converting an edited board state into a legal move post-edit is a very impressive result! I consider it very strong evidence both that the probe has discovered something real, and that the representation found by the probe is causally linked to the model's actual computation!"

        "\n",
        "I was very interested in this paper, because it simultaneously had the fascinating finding of an emergent world model (and I'm also generally into any good interp paper), yet something felt off. The techniques used here seemed \"too\" powerful. The results were strong enough that something here seemed clearly real, but my intuition is that if you've really understood a model's internals, you should just be able to understand and manipulate it with far simpler techniques, like linear probes and interventions, and it's easy to be misled by more powerful techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, my best guess about model internals is that the networks form [**decomposable, linear representations**](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=KiDMIteKCEXt_EkR2sZCOfbG): that the model computes a bunch of useful features, and represents these as directions in activation space. See [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#motivation) for some excellent exposition on this. This is decomposable because each feature can vary independently (from the perspective of the model - on the data distribution they're likely dependent), and linear because we can extract a feature by projecting onto that feature's direction (if the features are orthogonal - if we have something like [superposition](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=3br1psLRIjQCOv2T4RN3V6F2) it's messier). This is a natural way for models to work - they're fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications with some non-linearities stuck in convenient places, and a decomposable, linear representation allows it to extract any combination of features with a linear map!\n",
        "\n",
        "Under this framework, if a feature can be found by a linear probe then the model has already computed it, and if that feature is used in a circuit downstream, we should be able to causally intervene with a linear intervention, just changing the coordinate along that feature's direction. So the fascinating finding that linear probes do not work, but non-linear probes do, suggests that either the model has a fundamentally non-linear representation of features (which it is capable of using directly for downstream computation!), or there's a linear representation of simpler and more natural features, from which the probe computes board state. My prior was on a linear representation of simpler features, but the causal intervention findings felt like moderate evidence for the non-linear representation. And the non-linear representation hypothesis would be a big deal if true! If you want to reverse-engineer a model, you need to have a crisp picture of how its computation maps onto activations and weights, and this would break a lot of my beliefs about how this correspondance works! Further, linear representations are just really *convenient* to reverse-engineer, and this would make me notably more pessimistic about mechanistic interpretability working."

        "Moving back to layer 3, it seems the model already has a pretty good board state representation by this point, but it's missing a few things (most notably it thinks C5 and especially C6 are white when they're actually black). My guess is that the board state calculation circuits haven't quite finished and are doing some iterative reasoning - if those cells have been taken several times, maybe it needs a layer to track the next earliest time it was taken? I don't know, and figuring this out would be a great starter project if you want to explore!"

The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",

I'd personally point to a few key factors (though note that this is my personal hot take, is not comprehensive, and I'm sure other researchers have their own views!):\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Conceptual frameworks**: To reverse-engineer a transformer, you need to know how to think like a transformer. Questions like: What kinds of algorithms is it natural for a transformer to represent, and how? Are features and circuits the right way to think about it? Is it even reasonable to expect that reverse-engineering is possible? How can we tell if a hypothesis or technique is principled vs hopelessly confused? What does it even mean to have truly identified a feature or circuit?\n",

        "*   **Practical Knowledge/Techniques**: Understanding models is hard, and being able to do this in practice is hard. Getting better at this both looks like forming a better toolkit of techniques that help us form true beliefs about models, and also just having a bunch of practical experience with finding circuits and refining the tools - can we find any cases where they break? How can we best interpret the results?\n",
        "    *   A concrete way this is hard is that models contain many circuits, each of which only activates on certain inputs. To identify a circuit we must first identify where it is and what it does, out of the morass! Activation patching (used in ROME, Interpretability in the Wild and refined with causal scrubbing) is an important innovation here.\n",
        "*   **Understanding MLP Layers**: 2/3 of the parameters in transformers are in MLP layers, which process the information collected at each token position. We're pretty bad understanding them, and getting better at this is vital!\n",

        "    *   [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) helped clarify my conceptual frameworks re superposition, but there's still a lot more to de-confuse! And a _lot_ of work to do to form the techniques to deal with it in practice. I'm still not aware of a single satisfying example of really understanding a circuit involving MLPs in a language model\n",
        "*   **Scalability**: LLMs are _big_, and getting bigger all the time. Even if we solve all of the above in eg four layer transformers, this could easily involve some very ad-hoc and labour intensive techniques. Will this transfer to models far larger? And how well do the conceptual frameworks we form transformer - do they just break on models that are much more complex?\n",
        "    *   This often overlaps with forming techniques (eg, causal scrubbing is an automated algorithm with the potential to scale, modulo figuring out many efficiency and implementation details). But broadly I don't see much work on this publicly, and would be excited to see more - in particular, checking how well our conceptual frameworks transfer, and whether all the work on small models is a bit of a waste of time!\n",
        "        *   My personal hot take is that I'm more concerned about never getting _really_ good at interpreting a four layer model, than about scaling _if_ we're really good at four layer models - both because I just feel pretty confused about even small models, and because taking understood yet labour-intensive techniques and making them faster and more automatable seems hard but doable (especially with near-AGI systems!). But this is a complex empirical question and I could easily be wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within this worldview, what should our research goals be? Fundamentally, I'm an empiricist - models are hard and confusing, it's easy to trick yourself, and often intuitions can mislead. The core thing of any research project is getting feedback from reality, and using it to form true beliefs about models. This can either look like forming explicit hypotheses and testing them, or exploring a model and seeing what you stumble upon, but the fundamental question is whether you have the potential to be surprised and to get feedback from reality.\n",

But it's extremely easy for them to cease to be relevant to real LLMs and become a nerd-snipe.

        "To me, working on Othello-GPT is essentially a bet on (2), that there in gneeral some are underlying principles of transformers and how they learn circuits, and that the way they manifest in Othello-GPT can teach us things about real models. This is definitely wrong in _some_ ways (I don't expect the specific circuits we find to be in GPT-3!), and it's plausible this is wrong in enough ways to be not worth working on, but I think it seems plausible enough to be a worthwhile research direction.

        "There's a bunch of key disanalogies to be careful of! Othello is fundamentally not the same task as language: Othello is a much simpler task, there's only 60 moves, there's a rigid and clearly defined syntax with correct and incorrect answers (not a continuous mess), the relevant info about moves so far can be _fully_ captured by the current board state, and generally many sub-tasks in language will not apply.\n",
        "\n",
        "But it's also surprisingly analogous, at least by the standards of toy models! Most obviously, it's a transformer trained to predict the next token! But the task is also much more complex than eg modular addition, and it has to do it in weird ways! The way I'd code Othello is by doing it recursively - find the board state at move n and use it to get the state at move n+1. But transformers can't do this, they need to do things with a fixed number of serial steps but with a lot of computation in parallel (ie, at every move it must simultaneously compute the board state _at that move_ in parallel) - it's not obvious to me how to do this, and I expect that the way it's encoded will teach me a lot about how to represent certain kinds of algorithms in transformers. And it needs to be solving a bunch of sub-tasks that interact in weird ways (eg, a piece can be taken multiple times in each of four different directions), computing and remembering a lot of information, and generally forming coherent circuits.\n",

        "In the next few sections I'll argue for how finding modular circuits can help build **practical knowledge and techniques**, what we could learn from **understanding its MLPs**, and more broadly how it could act as a laboratory for forming better **conceptual frameworks** (it's clearly not a good way to study scalability lol)\n",

        "### This is not about world models\n",
        "\n",
        "A high-level clarification: Though the focus of the original paper was on understanding how LLMs can form emergent world models, this is _not_ why I am arguing for these research directions. My interpretation of the original paper was that it was strong evidence for the fact that it's _possible_ for \"predict the next token\" models to form world emergent models, despite never having explicit access to the ground truth of the world/board state. I personally was already convinced that this was possible, but think the authors did great work that showed this convincingly and well (and I am even more convinced after my follow-up!), and that there's not much more to say on the \"is this possible\" question.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's many interesting questions about whether these happen _in practice_ in LLMs and what this might look like and how to interpret it - my personal guess is that they do _sometimes_, but are pretty expensive (in terms of parameters and residual stream bandwidth) and only form when it's high value for reducing next token loss and the model is big enough to afford it. Further, there's often much cheaper hacks, eg, BingChat doesn't need to have formed an explicit chess board model to be decent at playing legal moves in chess! Probably not even for reasonably good legal play: the chess board state is _way_ easier than Othello, pieces can't even change colour! And you can get away with an implicit rather than explicit world model that just computes the relevant features from the context, eg to see where to a move a piece from, just look up the most recent point where that piece was played and look at the position it was moved to.\n",
        "\n",
        "But Othello is very disanalogous to language here - playing legal moves in Othello has a single, perfectly sufficient world model that I can easily code up (though not quite in four transformer layers!), and which is incredibly useful for answering the underlying task! Naively, Othello-GPT roughly seems to be spending 128 of its 512 residual stream dimensions of this model, which is very expensive (though it's probably using superposition). So while it's a proof of concept that world models are possible, I don't think the finer details here tell us much about whether these world models actually happen in real LLMs. This seems best studied by actually looking at language models, and [I think there's many exciting questions here](/posts/XNjRwEX9kxbpzWFWd/200-cop-in-mi-looking-for-circuits-in-the-wild)! (eg doing mech interp on [Patel et al's work](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gJcEM8sxHK)) The point of my investigation was more to refine our conceptual frameworks for thinking about models/transformers, and the goal of these proposed directions is to push forward transformer mech interp in general.\n",

        "\n",
        "This makes sense as a place to start! The inputs and outputs are inherently interpretable, and the most obvious thing to care about. But it stands in contrast to much of the image circuits work, that identified neurons representing interpretable features ([like curves](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-circuits)) and studied how they were computed and how these were used to computed more sophisticated features (like [car wheels -> cars](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in)). Let's consider the analogy of mech interp to reverse-engineering a compiled program binary to source code. End-to-end circuits are like thinking of the source code as a single massive block of code, and identifying which sections we can ignore.\n",
        "\n",
        "But a natural thing to aim for is to find **variables**, corresponding to interpretable activations within the network that correspond to **features**, some property of the input. The linear representation hypothesis says that these should be directions in activation space. It's not guaranteed that LLMs _are_ modular in the sense of forming interpretable intermediate features, but this seems implied by exiasting work, eg in the residual stream (often studied with probes), or in the MLP layers ([possibly as interpretable neurons](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html#section-6-3)). If we _can_ find interpretable variables, then the reverse-engineering task becomes much easier - we can now separately analyse the circuits that form the feature(s) from the inputs or earlier features, and the circuits that use the feature(s) to compute the output logits or more complex feature.\n",

Modular circuits mean that we can both re-use our work from finding circuits before, and hopefully have many fewer levels of composition. But they introduce a new challenge - how do we find exactly what direction corresponds to the feature output by the first circuit, ie the **interface** between the two circuits? I see two natural ways of doing this:\n",

        "So what does any of this have to do with Othello-GPT? I think we'll learn a lot by practicing finding modular circuits in Othello-GPT. Othello-GPT has a world model - clear evidence of spontaneous modularity - and our linear probe tells us where it is in the residual stream. And this can be intervened upon - so we know there are downstream circuits that use it. This makes it a great case study! By about layer 4, of the 512 dimensions of the residual stream, we have 64 directions corresponding to which cell has \"my colour\" and 60 directions corresponding to which cells are blank (the 4 center cells are never blank). This means we can get significant traction on what _any_ circuit is reading or writing from the residual stream.\n",

Othello-GPT cares a lot about the world model - the input format of a sequence of moves is hard and messy to understand, while \"is this move legal\" can be answered purely from the board state. So the model will likely devote significant resources to computing board state, forming fairly clean circuits.

By directly analyzing the weights of the policy and value heads, they found that the model stores information related to the probability of the pass move along the top edge of the board, and those related to the board value in checkerboard patterns.
